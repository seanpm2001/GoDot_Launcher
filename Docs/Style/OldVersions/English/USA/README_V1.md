# GoDot Launcher Docs

## Style

### General

The GoDot launcher will look similar to the classic Java Minecraft launcher. It will contain information on each GoDot release, along with an option to launch any specific GoDot version.

### Development by platform

#### Command Line

For now, the command line version will look very basic.

#### QT GUI

For platforms that work with KDE or QT in general, a replicant QT version will be available. It will be written in Python, and use QML as the graphic design language, instead of Tcl.

#### Vanilla GUI

For other Linux platforms, a UI will be made with either Python + TKinter or Python with Tcl.

#### Other

No other styles are currently planned.
