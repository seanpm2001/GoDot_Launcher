# GoDot Launcher

## Welcome to the GoDot Launcher documentation center

This is the documentation hub for GoDot launcher, a small and friendly launcher for GoDot.

## Note

GoDot Launcher is not affiliated with GoDot, but wouldn't mind being associated with them. This project is merely a launcher for GoDot.
