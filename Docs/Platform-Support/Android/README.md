# Android support

**Current status:** `Impossible`

Android currently cannot be supported, as GoDot does not support Android at the moment. Even when it is supported, Desktop Linux support must be established before I start work on aN Android port of ths project. When Android is supported, all versions of Android that GoDot supports (or has supported) will be supported by the GoDot launcher.
