# BSD support

**Current status:** `Queued`

BSD may be a bit tricky to support. However, Desktop Linux support must be established before I start work on a BSD port of ths project. When BSD is supported, all versions of BSD that GoDot supports (or has supported) will be supported by the GoDot launcher.
