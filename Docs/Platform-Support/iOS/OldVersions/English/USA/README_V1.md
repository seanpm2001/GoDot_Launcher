# iOS support

**Current status:** `Impossible`

iOS/iPhoneOS/iPadOS currently cannot be supported, as GoDot does not support iOS at the moment. Even when it is supported, Desktop Linux support must be established before I start work on an iOS port of ths project. When iOS is supported, all versions of iOS that GoDot supports (or has supported) will be supported by the GoDot launcher.
